### Description

Subwaze is a mobile first responsive application to give mass transit commuters the ability to have more accurate information before and during their daily commute.

### Problem Statement

How does one avoid timely and costly delays while using mass transit?

### Solution

### Challenges

The data structure was an evolving process and involved learning how to access deeply nested objects, arrays, an individually specific items. This was a big win in understanding how to structure an application from a data access perspective. Also, using React exposed weaknesses in my understanding of certain parts, particulary planning components with what they may require with repect to state, and how to add seperate fucntionality to child components.

This app will be re-developed from the ground up to have a better user experience, utilize a third party api, and add much more functionality and styling
