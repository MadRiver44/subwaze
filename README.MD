### Description

Subwaze is a mobile first responsive application to give mass transit commuters the ability to have more accurate information before and during their daily commute.

### Problem Statement

How does one avoid timely and costly delays while using mass transit?

### Solution

Develop an App to monitor in real time MTA train alert status as well as current rider comments. The current rider comments act as verification of MTA provided information with the potential to amplify the informational 'truthiness' of the MTA.

### Challenges

Conditional rendering was one of the biggest challenges. We wanted our app to be 'uasble' for both logged in users and non-logged in users.
So we ended up creating different routes to the same page, passing in different information. We also wanted certain elements to be rendered, or not rendered, based on
status of the user, having favorites, and only being able to edit or delete their own comments, etc. Navagating EJS was another challenge.
We we're brand new to using EJS as a view engine. Got off to a rocky start but ended up finding it very helpful with our conditional rendering. And GIT, ohhh git, how I both love, and hate you're marvelous face! Merging our branches was definitely one of our biggest challenges. We often found ourselves editing the same files, and ended up running into alot of merge conflicts. Deploying also to Heroku proved itself to be harder than we thought.

This app will be re-developed from the ground up to have a better user experience, utilize a third party api, and add much more functionality and styling
